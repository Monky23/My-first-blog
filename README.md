# My-first-blog

Context
Creation of a blog in PHP without Framework. 

Description of the need
The project is to develop my professional blog. 
This website is divided into two main groups of pages :

pages useful to all visitors ;
the pages allowing to manage my blog.
Here is the list of pages that will be accessible from my website:

the home page ; //public
the page listing all the blog posts ; //public
the page displaying a blog post; //public
the page allowing to add a blog post ; //for admins 
the page allowing to modify a blog post ; //for admins
the pages allowing to modify/delete a blog post ; //for admins
the pages for logging in/registering users. 
I have to develop an administration part that will be accessible only to registered and validated users. 

The administration pages will be accessible on conditions and I must ensure the security of the administration part.

Let's start with the pages that are useful to all users.

On the home page, you will have to present the following information:

my name and first name ;
a photo and/or a logo;
a catchphrase that looks like me (example: "Jean Michel La Paix, the code in action!");
a menu allowing to navigate among all the pages of my website;
a contact form (upon submission of this form, an e-mail with all this information will be sent to me) with the following fields :
name/first name,
contact e-mail,
message,
a link to my CV in PDF format;
and all the links to the social networks where you can be followed (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter...).

On the page listing all blog posts (from the most recent to the oldest), you should display the following information for each blog post:

the title ;
the date of last modification ;
the caption ;
and a link to the blog post.

On the page showing the details of a blog post, the following information should be displayed:

the title ;
the caption ;
the content ;
the author ;
the date of last update ;
the form allowing to add a comment (submitted for validation);
the lists of validated and published comments.
On the page allowing to modify a blog post, the user has the possibility to modify the title, caption, author and content fields.

In the footer menu, there should be a link to access the blog administration.
